**Coding challenges **

I'll try to solve challenging (mainly mathematical) progrmaming problems here. Currently only looking at challenges from Project Euler, which is a series of challenging programming problems. It can be read about here: https://projecteuler.net/

I'm not putting too much time into these problems, will only do so when I'm bored.
